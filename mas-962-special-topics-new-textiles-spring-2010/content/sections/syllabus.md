Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Two sessions / week: 3 hours for 1st session, 1 hour for 2nd session

The longer session each week will tend to focus on in-class activities requiring more time, while the shorter session will tend to feature guest lecturers.

Prerequisites
-------------

While useful, prior experience with textiles, electronics, and programming is not required.

Textbook
--------

Kadolph, S. J., and A. L. Langford. _Textiles_. 10th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2007. ISBN: 9780131187696.
