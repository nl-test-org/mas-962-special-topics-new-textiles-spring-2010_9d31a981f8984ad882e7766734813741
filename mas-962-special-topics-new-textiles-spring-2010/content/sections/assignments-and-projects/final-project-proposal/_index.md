For your final project, you should explore a specific set of materials, techniques, or applications in depth. You are very welcome (in fact encouraged) to work in groups. The project could take many different forms, including:

*   A finished garment with unique functionality or material composition.
*   A finished textile with unique functionality or material composition.
*   A prototype for a new tool that could help others work with textiles and technology.
*   A series of documented material or technique explorations.

The final project proposal will consist of a short (5 minute) formal presentation in class, plus a brief online description. Your presentation should include:

1.  A concise description of your project.
2.  Preliminary investigations of previous work in the area.
3.  If you are planning a project whose outcome is a specific artifact (ie: a garment or textile), sketches of the artifact.
4.  A time line.

Create a webpage for your proposal. It should contain a short description and a downloadable version of your presentation.
