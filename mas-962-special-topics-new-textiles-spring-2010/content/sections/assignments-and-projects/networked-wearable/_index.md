For this assignment you will work in teams, in collaboration with the _21W.789 Communicating with Mobile Technology_ class, to build a textile that talks to a mobile phone. With your team you should create a webpage that documents your project. Your page should include pictures and a discussion of your experience. Also create a short video of your project in action; post the video online (Vimeo, YouTube, or your own site) and include a link to your video in your documentation page.

### Make a Textile Arduino

![Drawing of a circular piece of fabric with an ATMega168 microcontroller IC in the center. Many leads connect to labeled conductive regions on the fabric, and several regions include other electronic components.](/courses/media-arts-and-sciences/mas-962-special-topics-new-textiles-spring-2010/assignments-and-projects/networked-wearable/textile_arduino.jpg)

An example textile Arduino circuit.

Here's a diagram that shows how the ATMega168 pins are mapped to Arduino pins:
